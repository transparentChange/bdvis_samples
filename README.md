# bdvisSamples
This script takes biodiversity data and saves a series of data visualizations created through the bdvis library to folders created in the working directory.

Some examples of the visualizations created are: grid-based heat maps, tempolar graphs, histograms.  

The specific data used was on the African Lion, Panthera Leo, and was retreived from GBIF using R's package rgbif.
