# bdvisSamples
Takes biodiversity data and saves a series of data visualizations created through the bdvis library to the working directory.
The supplementary VisualizationCompilation.R file allows for the resultant png images to be arranged together in a grid-like fashion.  

Some examples of the visualizations created are: grid-based heat maps, tempolar graphs, histograms.  

The specific data used was on the African Lion, Panthera Leo, and was retreived from GBIF using R's package rgbif.
